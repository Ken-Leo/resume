  abstract = {Nonlinear transition shift (NLTS) produced by the interaction between transitions is a major source of distortions in magnetic recording. NLTS must be reduced to realize higher density and maintain signal quality. However, there is some confusion about the production and behavior of NLTS in previous reports. In this paper, combined with micromagnetic simulation, we have developed a complete theoretical model to predict NLTS on perpendicular magnetic media. The results show that one-level NLTS (caused by one previous transition) will monotonically decrease as the present transition becomes further away from the previous one, and multilevel NLTS (caused by consecutive previous transitions) will firstly increase and quickly approach a constant value as there are more consecutive transitions. Particularly, it is demonstrated that NLTS and its impact on the media signal-to-noise ratio can be significantly limited by pattern constraints.},

  abstract = {The light delivery system with a light spot is the key component of heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR). We proposed a semi-circle resonator system as the light delivery system for HAMR. It consists of only a semi-circle resonator, a reflecting mirror, and a near-field transducer (NFT). The resonator can provide a stable enhanced optical field to excite the localized surface plasmon of NFT without complex focusing lenses or external controls. Numerical results show that the size of light spots can be 20–40 nm with a good field enhancement. Combined with bit-patterned media, the performance can be improved several times than the thin-film structure. The thermal profile of the light spot shows that the areal density of HAMR can further improve beyond the limit size of light spots, and the recording bit can be reduced to 12×12 nm2 corresponding to the areal density of about 4 Tb/in2.},
